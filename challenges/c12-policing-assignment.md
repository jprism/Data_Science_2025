*Purpose*: In this last challenge we’ll focus on using logistic
regression to study a large, complicated dataset. Interpreting the
results of a model can be challenging—both in terms of the statistics
and the real-world reasoning—so we’ll get some practice in this
challenge.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and
supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit
a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without
all files uploaded to GitHub.**

*Background*: We’ll study data from the [Stanford Open Policing
Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/), specifically their
dataset on Massachusetts State Patrol police stops.

# Setup

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Go to the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) page and download the Massachusetts State Police records in `Rds` format. Move the data to your `data` folder and match the `filename` to load the data.

*Note*: An `Rds` file is an R-specific file format. The function
`readRDS` will read these files.

``` r
## TODO: Download the data, move to your data folder, and load it
filename <- "./data/yg821jf8611_ma_statewide_2020_04_01.rds"
df_data <- readRDS(filename)
```

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q2** Do your “first checks” on the dataset. What are the basic facts about this dataset?

``` r
glimpse(df_data)
```

**Observations**:

- What are the basic facts about this dataset?

- Over 3 million rows

- 24 columns

- Both subject race and raw race

- info about suspect as well as information about the car and the reason
  for the stop

- says if there was different types of contraband and if a frisk was
  done

- records location and date of traffic stop

  Note that we have both a `subject_race` and `race_Raw` column. There
  are a few possibilities as to what `race_Raw` represents:

<!-- -->

- `race_Raw` could be the race of the police officer in the stop
- `race_Raw` could be an unprocessed version of `subject_race`

Let’s try to distinguish between these two possibilities.

### **q3** Check the set of factor levels for `subject_race` and `raw_Race`. What do you note about overlap / difference between the two sets?

``` r
## TODO: Determine the factor levels for subject_race and raw_Race

df_data %>%
  pull(subject_race) %>%
  unique()
```

    ## [1] white                  hispanic               black                 
    ## [4] asian/pacific islander other                  <NA>                  
    ## [7] unknown               
    ## Levels: asian/pacific islander black hispanic white other unknown

``` r
df_data %>%
  pull(raw_Race) %>%
  unique()
```

    ## [1] "White"                                        
    ## [2] "Hispanic"                                     
    ## [3] "Black"                                        
    ## [4] "Asian or Pacific Islander"                    
    ## [5] "Middle Eastern or East Indian (South Asian)"  
    ## [6] "American Indian or Alaskan Native"            
    ## [7] NA                                             
    ## [8] "None - for no operator present citations only"
    ## [9] "A"

**Observations**:

- What are the unique values for `subject_race`?
- white, hispanic, black, asian/pacific islander, NA, unknown
- What are the unique values for `raw_Race`?
- White, hispanic, black, asian or pacific islander, middle eastern or
  east indian, american indian or alaskan native, NA, none - for no
  operator present citations only, A
- What is the overlap between the two sets?
  - White, hispanic, black, asian or pacific islander
- What is the difference between the two sets?
  - raw also has middle eastern and american indian as well as an option
    for when no operator is present

### **q4** Check whether `subject_race` and `raw_Race` match for a large fraction of cases. Which of the two hypotheses above is most likely, based on your results?

*Note*: Just to be clear, I’m *not* asking you to do a *statistical*
hypothesis test.

``` r
## TODO: Devise your own way to test the hypothesis posed above.

num_rows <-
  df_data %>%
  nrow()

num_same <- df_data %>%
  filter(
    (is.na(subject_race) & is.na(raw_Race)) |
    (subject_race == "white" & raw_Race == "White") |
    (subject_race == "hispanic" & raw_Race == "Hispanic") |
    (subject_race == "black" & raw_Race == "Black") |
    (subject_race == "asian/pacific islander" & raw_Race == "Asian or Pacific Islander")
  ) %>%
  nrow()

num_same / num_rows
```

    ## [1] 0.9729015

**Observations**

Between the two hypotheses:

- `race_Raw` could be the race of the police officer in the stop
- `race_Raw` could be an unprocessed version of `subject_race`

which is most plausible, based on your results?

- 97.29 percent of the races match each other. This is very high so I
  would say that the second hypotheses is likely correct and raw race is
  a version of subject_race prior to processing.

## Vis

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q5** Compare the *arrest rate*—the fraction of total cases in which the subject was arrested—across different factors. Create as many visuals (or tables) as you need, but make sure to check the trends across all of the `subject` variables. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
arrest_rate_fun <- function(group) {
  arrests_by_group <-
    df_data %>%
    group_by({{group}}, arrest_made) %>%
    summarise(
      total = n()
    ) %>%
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = arrest_made,
      values_from = total
    ) %>%
    mutate(
      total_encounters = sum(`FALSE`, `TRUE`, `NA`),
      arrest_rate = `TRUE`/`total_encounters`
    ) %>%
    rename(
      "num_arrested" = `TRUE`
    ) %>%
    select(
      c({{group}}, num_arrested, total_encounters, arrest_rate)
    )    
  arrests_by_group %>%
    ggplot(aes({{group}},arrest_rate)) +
      geom_point()  
}

arrest_rate_fun(subject_age)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'subject_age'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## Warning: Removed 33 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

![](c12-policing-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-3.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- How does `arrest_rate` tend to vary with `subject_age`?
  - arrest rate peaks around 26 with it dropping off towards 0 for
    elderly people
- How does `arrest_rate` tend to vary with `subject_sex`?
  - Females get arrested less than half as often as men
- How does `arrest_rate` tend to vary with `subject_race`?
  - Histpanic get arrested the most with a 6 percent rate while asians
    are as low as ~1.8 percent. Black people have the second highest
    rate at ~3 percent

# Modeling

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

We’re going to use a model to study the relationship between `subject`
factors and arrest rate, but first we need to understand a bit more
about *dummy variables*

### **q6** Run the following code and interpret the regression coefficients. Answer the the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; inspect the estimated model terms.
fit_q6 <-
  glm(
    formula = arrest_made ~ subject_age + subject_race + subject_sex,
    data = df_data %>%
      filter(
        !is.na(arrest_made),
        subject_race %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic")
      ),
    family = "binomial"
  )

fit_q6 %>% tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 5
    ##   term                 estimate std.error statistic   p.value
    ##   <chr>                   <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)           -2.67    0.0132      -202.  0        
    ## 2 subject_age           -0.0142  0.000280     -50.5 0        
    ## 3 subject_racehispanic   0.513   0.0119        43.3 0        
    ## 4 subject_racewhite     -0.380   0.0103       -37.0 3.12e-299
    ## 5 subject_sexfemale     -0.755   0.00910      -83.0 0

**Observations**:

- Which `subject_race` levels are included in fitting the model?
  - hispanic, black, and white
- Which `subject_race` levels have terms in the model?
  - white and hispanic

You should find that each factor in the model has a level *missing* in
its set of terms. This is because R represents factors against a
*reference level*: The model treats one factor level as “default”, and
each factor model term represents a change from that “default” behavior.
For instance, the model above treats `subject_sex==male` as the
reference level, so the `subject_sexfemale` term represents the *change
in probability* of arrest due to a person being female (rather than
male).

The this reference level approach to coding factors is necessary for
[technical
reasons](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/achoulde/94842/lectures/lecture10/lecture10-94842.html#why-is-one-of-the-levels-missing-in-the-regression),
but it complicates interpreting the model results. For instance; if we
want to compare two levels, neither of which are the reference level, we
have to consider the difference in their model coefficients. But if we
want to compare all levels against one “baseline” level, then we can
relevel the data to facilitate this comparison.

By default `glm` uses the first factor level present as the reference
level. Therefore we can use
`mutate(factor = fct_relevel(factor, "desired_level"))` to set our
`"desired_level"` as the reference factor.

### **q7** Re-fit the logistic regression from q6 setting `"white"` as the reference level for `subject_race`. Interpret the the model terms and answer the questions below.

``` r
## TODO: Re-fit the logistic regression, but set "white" as the reference
## level for subject_race
fit_q7 <-
  glm(
    formula = arrest_made ~ subject_age + subject_race + subject_sex,
    data = df_data %>%
      filter(
        !is.na(arrest_made),
        subject_race %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic")
      ) %>%
      mutate(
        subject_race = fct_relevel(factor(subject_race), "white")
      ),
    family = "binomial"
  )

fit_q7 %>% tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 5
    ##   term                 estimate std.error statistic   p.value
    ##   <chr>                   <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)           -3.05    0.0109      -279.  0        
    ## 2 subject_age           -0.0142  0.000280     -50.5 0        
    ## 3 subject_raceblack      0.380   0.0103        37.0 3.12e-299
    ## 4 subject_racehispanic   0.893   0.00859      104.  0        
    ## 5 subject_sexfemale     -0.755   0.00910      -83.0 0

**Observations**:

- Which `subject_race` level has the highest probability of being
  arrested, according to this model? Which has the lowest probability?
  - Hispanic has a higher chance than black people according to this
    model. (white technically has the lowest)
- What could explain this difference in probabilities of arrest across
  race? List **multiple** possibilities.
  - Racial bias / racism
  - size of the population of those races in massachussets
  - gangs
  - way that police officers are trained to treat black people, but not
    taught to avoid bias with hispanics in the same way
- Look at the set of variables in the dataset; do any of the columns
  relate to a potential explanation you listed?
  - Contraband would help determine if the people were involved in crime
    or gangs.

One way we can explain differential arrest rates is to include some
measure indicating the presence of an arrestable offense. We’ll do this
in a particular way in the next task.

### **q8** Re-fit the model using a factor indicating the presence of contraband in the subject’s vehicle. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
## TODO: Repeat the modeling above, but control for whether contraband was found
## during the police stop
fit_q8 <-
  glm(
    formula = arrest_made ~ subject_age + subject_race + subject_sex + contraband_found,
    data = df_data %>%
      filter(
        !is.na(arrest_made),
        subject_race %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic")
      ) %>%
      mutate(
        subject_race = fct_relevel(factor(subject_race), "white")
      ),
    family = "binomial"
  )

fit_q8 %>% tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 5
    ##   term                 estimate std.error statistic   p.value
    ##   <chr>                   <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)           -1.72    0.0339      -50.8  0        
    ## 2 subject_age            0.0225  0.000866     26.0  2.19e-149
    ## 3 subject_raceblack     -0.0511  0.0270       -1.90 5.80e-  2
    ## 4 subject_racehispanic   0.221   0.0237        9.31 1.32e- 20
    ## 5 subject_sexfemale     -0.306   0.0257      -11.9  1.06e- 32
    ## 6 contraband_foundTRUE   0.609   0.0192       31.7  4.29e-221

**Observations**:

- How does controlling for found contraband affect the `subject_race`
  terms in the model?
  - Controlling for contraband makes it significantly less likely that a
    black person will be arrested. While hispanic people are still
    likely to be arrested.
- What does the *finding of contraband* tell us about the stop? What
  does it *not* tell us about the stop?
  - It tells us that there was a crime committed. It doesn’t tell us if
    that the cop knew anything about the contraband when they initiated
    the stop or if racial bias influenced the stop starting in the first
    place.

### **q9** Go deeper: Pose at least one more question about the data and fit at least one more model in support of answering that question.

``` r

**Observations**:

- I looked at the effect on the reason for the stop on arrests being
  made
  - A seatbelt stop is the most likely to lead to arrest
    - This makes sense as it might be connected to DUIs
  - After that seatbelt, childrest is next
  - followed by a speeding stop
    - This also makes sense as a common stop as people the speeding is
      likely the most common stop and it can often lead to arrest if
      other confounding factors are found during the stop.
